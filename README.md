<!-- No screenshot: phone shows personal data (your own phone). -->

> *Doot* (दूत) is Sanskrit for "messenger": the messenger that carries files, the clipboard and pings to your phone.

doot is your phone, through KDE Connect for [Vyom](https://github.com/Theyashsawarkar/vyom): one keyboard-driven panel that opens instantly, with live data, a preview and a key for everything. It runs on any compositor with the layer-shell protocol (sway, Hyprland, river, niri, Wayfire, labwc…). In [Vayu](https://github.com/Theyashsawarkar/vayu), the desktop it was built for, it replaces phone-picker.py.

## Features

- The phone's **battery, charging and mobile signal** at a glance.
- Its actions as rows: send the clipboard, **send a recent file** (from Downloads, Pictures, Documents…), ring it to find it, ping it, browse its storage, unpair.
- Pairing requests at the top with Accept / Reject and the verification key; other known devices below (pair the reachable ones).
- Keyboard first: every action has a key, shown in the footer; the mouse works too.
- Never freezes the panel: slow commands run in the background.

## Install

### Requirements

- [Vyom](https://github.com/Theyashsawarkar/vyom) 0.2 or newer (Python 3.11+, PyGObject, GTK 4, [gtk4-layer-shell](https://github.com/wmww/gtk4-layer-shell), a Nerd Font)
- `kdeconnect-cli`, `busctl`
- optional: wl-paste (send clipboard)
- optional: yazi + kitty (browse)

### Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Theyashsawarkar/doot ~/.local/share/vyom/plugins/doot
vyom reload           # pick it up (or log out and in)
vyom doot            # open it; run it again to close
```

Give it a key in your compositor, e.g. sway:

```sh
bindsym $mod+<key> exec vyom doot
```

### Update and uninstall

```sh
git -C ~/.local/share/vyom/plugins/doot pull && vyom reload     # update
rm -rf ~/.local/share/vyom/plugins/doot && vyom reload          # uninstall
```

## Usage

Open it with `vyom doot` (or your key). Type to search; the footer always shows the keys for what's selected.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Enter` | Run the selected phone action (send, ring, browse...) |
| `Backspace (empty search)` | Go back from the file list |
| `Esc` | Close the panel |

Every Vyom panel also has `Up`/`Down` (or `Ctrl+K`/`Ctrl+J`) to move, `Page Up`/`Page Down` to jump and `Tab` to switch to the next tool.

## Configuration

Everything is optional, in `~/.config/vyom/config.toml` under `[plugin.doot]`:

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `browse_command` | yazi in kitty, else xdg-open | How to open the phone's storage (`{path}` is replaced) |

Run `vyom reload` after editing.

## Troubleshooting

- **Nothing opens.** `vyom list` shows every installed tool, and why one is skipped (a missing requirement, or a Vyom that's too old).
- **It opened, then something failed.** Look for a `Traceback` in the daemon's log, `journalctl --user -u vyom -u vyom-daemon -b` (without systemd: `~/.local/state/vyom/daemon.log`), and [open an issue](https://github.com/Theyashsawarkar/doot/issues/new/choose) with it.
- **No blur or rounded corners.** That's the compositor: on SwayFX, add `layer_effects "vyom" { blur enable; corner_radius 20; shadows enable }`.
